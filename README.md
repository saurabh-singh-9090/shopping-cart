A functional shopping cart UI implemented with react js and redux. Used axios to fetch data from demo API. Here user can add products from home page and during checkout, user can also remove or add more items by clicking on left(- icon) and right(+ icon) respectively. User can also remove the selected product from the cart by clicking on delete red icon. Currently checkout UI is not ready. Working on it
